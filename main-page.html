                        Welcome to the Single Board Cluster Competition for students, where efficiency is the key to success! 
                        In this competition, we challenge you to create the most efficient single board computer cluster that can perform complex tasks while using the least amount of power and resources.

                        To ensure a level playing field for all participants, the competition has a few rules and requirements. 
                        Participants are not allowed to use Apple M1-M4 processors, and their clusters must have a minimum of 4 sockets. 
                        MPI is required, and there is a power limit of <b>250 watts</b> and a cost limit of <b>$6,000</b>.

                    What is a SBC Cluster?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A Single Board Computer (SBC) cluster refers to a group of single-board computers that are interconnected to work together as a unified computing system. 
                    Each single-board computer is a complete computer built on a single circuit board, typically with a processor, memory, storage, and various other components. 
                    When these SBCs are connected in a cluster, they can collectively perform tasks that would be challenging for a single board to handle alone. 
                    Clustering allows for parallel processing, where multiple computers work on different parts of a task simultaneously, potentially speeding up computation.
