            Rules for SBCC
        </h1>
        <p>
            The Single Board Computer Competition (SBCC) has set the following rules to ensure fair and equal competition among participants. 
            First, Apple M1-M5 chips are off-limits. 
            Additionally, participants must use a minimum of 4 sockets and run MPI. 
            The power limit is set at 250 watts, and the cost limit is $6,000 MSRP (American MSRP). 
            <br><br>
            The competition will include benchmarking challenges, such as the High-Performance Linpack (HPL) and xx and xx. 
            There is a application challenge, which will be the xx and the Mystery Application. 
            The Mystery Application will be revealed on the day of the competition. 
            <br><br>
            The SBCC competition will be held virtually. 
            The event will take place on April 10-12th.
            <br><br>
            To measure efficiency, the GFLOPS/watt for the chips being tested will be recorded based on HPL results. 
            A sample result of what is expected can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/deater/performance_results">https://github.com/deater/performance_results</a>. 
            We just want a table with the chips and the gflops/watt. 
            <br><br>
            The SBCC competition presents a unique opportunity for participants to showcase their skills in building and optimizing single board computer clusters, while also gaining valuable knowledge and experience in the field of high-performance computing.
